          <p class="defeat1">Subjectively one of the greatest written works of man. The older I get the more the words in this mean to me. I wish we all were taught to learn from our defeats. To wear our blackened eyes with pride. To grow. To risk failure. To never get complacent. To never reach fullness. </p>

          <p class="defeat2">The last stanza is the most impactful to me and gives me the most hope for a well lived life</p>
