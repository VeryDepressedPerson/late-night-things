        <p>Once on a yellow peice of paper with green lines
            he wrote a poem
            and he called it "chops"
            because that was the name of his dog
            and thats what it was all about
            his teacher gave him an A
            and a gold star
            and his mother hung it on the kitchen door
            and read it to his aunts.
            that was the year Father Tracy
            took all the kids to the zoo
            and he let them sing on the bus
            and his little sister was born
            with tiny nails and no hair
            and his mother and father kissed alot
            and the girl around the corner sent him a
            Valentine signed with a row of X's
            and he had to ask his father what the X's meant
            and his father always tucked him in bed at night
            and was always there to do it</p>

            <p>once on a piece of white paper with blue lines
                he wrote a poem
                he called it "Autumn"
                because that was the name of the season
                and that's what it was all about
                and his teacher gave him an A
                and asked him to write more clearly
                and his mother never hung it on the kithcen door
                beause of the new paint
                and the kids told him
                that Father Tracy smoked cigars
                and left butts on the pews
                and sometime they would burn holes
                that was the year his sister got glasses
                with thick lenses and black frames
                and the girl around the corner laughed
                when he asked her to go see santa claus
                and the kids told him why
                his mother and father kissed alot
                and his father never tucked him in bed at night
                and his father got mad
                when he cried for him to do it</p>

            <p>once on a paper torn from his notebook
                he wrote a poem
                and he called it "Innocence: A Question"
                because that was the question about his girl
                and thats what it was all about
                and his professor gave him an A
                and a strange steady look
                and his mother never hung it on the kitchen door
                because he never showed her
                that was the year Father Tracy died
                and he forgot how the end
                of the Apostles's Creed went
                and he caught his sister
                making out on the back porch
                and his mother and father never kissed
                or even talked
                and the girl around the corner
                wore too much make up
                that made him cough when he kissed her
                but he kissed her anyway
                becuase it was the thing to do
                and at 3 am he tucked himself into bed
                his father snoring soundly</p>

            <p>that's why on the back of a brown paper bag
                he tried another poem
                and he called it "Absolutely Nothing"
                because that's what it was really all about
                and he gave himself an A
                and a slash on each damned wrist
                and he hung it on the bathroom door
                because this time he didnt think
                he could reach the kitchen</p>
